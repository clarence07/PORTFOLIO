        <h1><b>Introduction</b></h1><br>
       
          <p style ="text-align: justify">Hi, I'm Clarence Urmatam, 20 years old. Currently residing in Cabuyao City, Laguna. As of now, I'm working on a BPO company as a Chat Support, assisting customers and addressing customers issues and resolve them in a timely and efficient manner.
            While I'm working, I'm also enrolled at college to pursue my degree on Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Right now, it is my 3rd year in college, and I'm planning to continue it while I am working.
            Yes, it is hard, but I'm fully motivated and determined to finish my college and also to help my family in providing financial support in this time of pandemic.</p><hr><br>

        <h1><b>Hobbies</b></h1><br>
          <p style ="text-align: justify">When we talk about my hobbies, there's a lot of it, but one of my favorite thing to do is Photography. I started taking simple shots using my phone, then later on I started enjoying it
            and a lot of my friends are saying that I'm good at it. Street Photography is my category, when I'm travelling to school, going home, and sometimes I go outside just to take photos. 
            Street photography, also can be also called candid photography, it is conducted for art or enquiry that features unmediated chance encounters and random incidents within public places. You can see below my sample photos taken from yours truly.</p><br>

        <p style ="text-align:justify">I'm also a artist, I started to draw when I was 14 years old. I tried multiple mediums like water color, ballpoint, colored pencil, and graphite or charcoal. Being an artist
        is always a big advantage for me, because I always able to express my creativity on everything that I do and by doing that I also communicate to other peope thru art on my own emotions, thoughts, and experiences.
        When I do arts, I'm letting the world see through me. Art also gives us meaning to our lives and helps us understand our world. Sometimes, I have been experiencing "art block" where I unconsciously feeling blank, it is when your motivation-well has run dry and you can't come up with any ideas.
         To overcome this, I'll just need to take a break, because sometimes you just need a good old break to recharge your creativity and take a breathe. </p><br>
    
        <p style ="text-align:justify">For many years of being an artist, I've met so many creative people that helped me to keep growing and inspired. I'm also joining competitions, and luckily I'm always on the top.
        I'm also part of an organization where all of the members are artist like me, it is JuanKaSining and Guhit Pinas Laguna. Here's my few artworks and photos from my organization.</p><br>

        <p style ="text-align:justify">My latest hobby right now is Cycling or riding a bike. When the pandemic started, the number of riders increased, then I also started to make it a try. My first ride is so memorable, we went to
        Marcos Twin Mansions on Brgy. Casile, Cabuyao, Laguna. At first, it is very hard for me, but then my friends encourage that I can do it, and later on I managed to do it. From that day, we started to take long rides with our bikes and went to
         several places that we never went to before. My last long ride with them is when we went to Fantasy World in Tagaytay, on that day it has been a super long day to us but it is totally worth it. Riding a bike for me is relaxing, although your 
        body can be exhausted, but your eyes will enjoy the view and you will be in peaceful mind. </p><br>

    <h1><b>Educational Background</b></h1><br>
    <p style ="text-align:justify">I'm currently a 3rd year in college in Polytechnic University of the Philippines Santa Rosa Campus, 
        taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, however, due to the pandemic and all, I decided to look for a job while I am studying. My life as a student becomes interesting in Senior High School where I graduated with honors and awarded for being perfect in attendance. While in college, 
        I chose IT as my course because first it is in demand, second is, I love to analyze problems and give a solution for it, and lastly is, I enjoyed making programs that makes our life easier. 
        From this 2 years and counting experience in IT course, I think I have earned multiple skills that will help in a work environment like, analyzation, problem solving, and being resourceful. In my first year in college, I've become a dean's lister,
          while in my second year I've become a president's lister. Studying in college, I always become a leader in our activities or projects, Im the person who will initiate and guide the group to finish the task correctly. Right now, I'm on the last 2 school years in college, and I'm hoping
        to graduate with latin honors or a dean's lister at least. Here's my couple of photos and achievements that I have gathered. </p><br>
